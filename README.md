# Calculator

*This is a remake of my first calculator but using Object-Oriented Programing that asks the user which basic operation (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division) they would like to choose and two numbers for the operation to be carried out.

## HELP

*If a problem is encountered while using the program kindly report them to the repository so that they may be addressed.
